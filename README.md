# phone-number-insights-performance-tests

Performance test suite for `phone-number-insights`, using [performance-test-runner](https://github.com/hmrc/performance-test-runner) under the hood.

## Pre-requisites

### Services

Start Mongo Docker container following instructions from the [MDTP Handbook](https://docs.tax.service.gov.uk/mdtp-handbook/documentation/developer-set-up/set-up-mongodb.html).

### Running locally
In order to run the service locally, you will need to have localstack installed to provide a local version of AWS
Secrets Manager which will be used to obtain the secrets required to connect to the Postgres database and for basic auth.

To run the service locally, you can use the following command:

```./run_local.sh```

This script will start localstack, create the required secrets in Secrets Manager, start a Postgres database in a Docker
container, and then start the Play application overriding the configuration to point to the localstack instance.
```bash
sm2 --start PLATFORM_TEST_EXAMPLE_UI_TESTS
```

### Logging

The default log level for all HTTP requests is set to `WARN`. Configure [logback.xml](src/test/resources/logback.xml) to update this if required.

### WARNING :warning:

Do **NOT** run a full performance test against staging from your local machine. Please [implement a new performance test job](https://docs.tax.service.gov.uk/mdtp-handbook/documentation/mdtp-test-approach/performance-testing/performance-test-a-microservice/index.html) and execute your job from the dashboard in [Performance Jenkins](https://performance.tools.staging.tax.service.gov.uk).

## Tests

Run smoke test (locally) as follows:

```bash
sbt -Dperftest.runSmokeTest=true -DrunLocal=true gatling:test
```

Run full performance test (locally) as follows:

```bash
sbt -DrunLocal=true gatling:test
```

Run smoke test (staging) as follows:

```bash
sbt -Dperftest.runSmokeTest=true -DrunLocal=false gatling:test
```

## Scalafmt

Check all project files are formatted as expected as follows:

```bash
sbt scalafmtCheckAll scalafmtCheck
```

Format `*.sbt` and `project/*.scala` files as follows:
